# Introduction to linguistic fundamentals

## What is language (good for)?

## What makes English special?

## What is linguistics (good for)?

![](img/what-is-linguistics-kortmann.png)

## Course description {.small}

This course introduces you to the fundamental components of English
linguistics, explains the major theoretical approaches and concepts in
these fields, and examines some methodological issues.

The curriculum consists of

- phonetics and phonology,
- morphology and word-formation,
- syntax,
- semantics and lexicology,
- pragmatics,
- sociolinguistics, and
- history of English.

The aim is to provide you with a broad foundation so that you can
specialise based on your interests in subsequent courses.

## Structuralism

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- The linguist who has, first and foremost, shaped linguistic thinking in the 20th century is **Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913)**. 
- We know about his theory of language from a set of lecture notes from a lecture delivered at Geneva university, which were published by his students as *Cours de linguistique générale* in 1916.

## De Saussure's primacy of synchrony and the system

Ferdinand de Saussure…

- focussed on synchrony — against the dominant trend in linguistics of the late 19th / early 20th centuries, which, almost exclusively, dealt with **language history**.

- advocated the study of *langue* rather than *parole*:
    - **langue**: the abstract linguistic system shared by all speakers of a speech community, which is independent of individual language users (→ abstract system).
    - **parole**: the concrete realisation of the abstract system provided by *langue*, which may be influenced by the speech situation, by a lack of concentration, by memory restrictions, etc. (→ concrete use by the individual).

:::: {.notes}
- 10:36–10:40 Synchrony vs history; langue vs parole.

## The model of the linguistic sign [@deSaussure1916Cours]

![@Bieswanger2021Introduction: 6](img/model-linguistic-sign.png)


## De Saussure’s concept of the linguistic sign

The linguistic sign has the following set of characteristics:

::: {.incremental}
- **Reciprocity**
  - The signifier/signifiant evokes the signified/signifié, and vice versa.
- **Arbitrariness**
  - This relationship is unmotivated. There is no obvious reason why a particular signifier should represent a certain signified.
- **Conventionality**
  - This relationship between signifier and signified is based upon an implicit ‘agreement’ between speakers of speech communities.
:::

:::: {.notes}
- 10:40–10:42 Three properties with quick examples.
::::


## Different types of signs: Peirce

Three major types of signs depending on the relationship between signifier and signified:

::: {.incremental}
- **symbol**
  - arbitrariness: lack of motivated link (cf. de Saussure’s linguistic sign)
- **icon**
  - similarity: visual, acoustic, … (e.g., meow for the cat)
- **index**
  - effect–cause or contiguity (i.e., proximity in space/time) (e.g., smoke as a sign of fire)
:::

---

### Exercise: symbols, icons, indices

Classify each sign and state the underlying relationship (arbitrariness, similarity, contiguity).

1. traffic light colours
2. portrait photo
3. smoke for fire
4. onomatopoeia of the word *click*
5. national flag of Japan for the country
6. wet footprints on the floor

| 6. wet footprints on the floor            | index      | contiguity (proximity in space/time) |

## Paradigmatic vs syntagmatic relations

Linguistic units (in phonology, word-formation, syntax etc.) stand in two types of relationships:

- Elements which co-occur in horizontal order form syntagms or "chain relationships".
- Elements which replace each other in the same functional slot form paradigms or "choice relationships".

![](img/syntagmatic-paradigmatic.png)

:::: {.notes}
- 10:43–10:44 Define chain vs choice; 1 example.
::::


## Linearity of language

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
Language is linear: Saussure's signifier unfolds in time along the syntagmatic chain.

- In chat, the platform serialises turns with timestamps; order itself creates meaning.
- Simultaneous cues (emoji, read receipts, voice notes) are anchored to points on the chain; the app linearises them.
- Interpretation is path‑dependent: earlier items license later ones (anaphora, ellipsis).
- Therefore, where spoken or written, language is always linear in the end.

## Aim of structuralism and emancipation from de Saussure

**Aim of Structuralism**: Identifying and describing elements in the system (on all levels of a language: sounds, words and their components, sentences and their constituents) in terms of their paradigmatic and syntagmatic relationships to other elements in the system.

Since the 1960s …

- renewed interest in language **variation** and **change** (vs primacy of synchrony)
- research into language use by individual speakers in different social situations → **pragmatics** & **sociolinguistics** (vs primacy of the system)
- recognition of **fuzzy boundaries/continua** and acceptance of dichotomies only as pedagogically useful idealisations (e.g., synchrony – diachrony, language system – language use, vocabulary – grammar, written language – spoken language)


## Synchrony vs diachrony

![Change of meaning over time [@Hamilton2016Diachronic]](img/change-of-meaning.png)

::: {.incremental}
- **Synchrony**: 
  - study of the language system at a single time point; internal relations among elements.
- **Diachrony**: 
  - study of change over time; how forms and meanings evolve.
:::

::: {.notes}
- 10:40–10:42 Diachrony example; quick pointer to semantics/lexicology.
:::


## Langue and parole

::: {layout="[60,40]"}
:::: {.incremental}
- **Langue**: 
  - rules of the game
  - abstract linguistic system shared by a speech community; grammar and lexicon independent of individual use
- **Parole**: 
  - how the game is actually played
  - concrete, individual language use in context; actual utterances with performance variation

:::: {.notes}
- 10:45–10:46 Anchor with chess metaphor.
::::


## Descriptivism vs prescriptivism

::: {layout="[60,40]"}
:::: {.incremental}
- **Descriptivism**
    - describes how speakers actually use language without judging forms as right or wrong.
    - e.g. accepting double negatives in some dialects as systematic grammar.
- **Prescriptivism**
    - sets rules for how people ought to use language, often based on tradition or style.
    - e.g. forbidding sentence‑final prepositions in formal writing.
::::

![](img/prescriptive.jpg)
:::

::: {.notes}
- 10:46–10:47 Contrast briefly; avoid rabbit hole.
:::


## Object language vs metalanguage

### Definitions

- **Object language**
  - language used as the subject of description or analysis (the examples themselves).
- **Metalanguage**
  - language used to talk about language (terms, rules, and descriptions).

### Examples

1. Saying *shit* is not allowed.
2. *verb* is a noun.
3. I don't know the word for *word* in Spanish.

::: {.notes}
- 10:47–10:48 Setup for exercise.
:::

---

### Exercise

1. The meaning of bank is ambiguous.
2. Noun phrases often start with the words the or a.
3. Morphology is the field of language which studies the formation of new words.
4. The past tense of verbs is formed by adding the suffix -ed.

   a) Replacing *student* with *teacher* in "The ___ reads the book"  
   b) Adding *quickly* after *reads*

- morphology and word-formation
- syntax
- semantics
- pragmatics
- sociolinguistics
- historical linguistics
- …


## Phonetics and phonology

***Our Strange Lingo* (Lord Cromer)**

When the English tongue we speak.  
Why is break not rhymed with freak?  
Will you tell me why it's true  
We say sew but likewise few?  
And the maker of the verse,  
Cannot rhyme his horse with worse?  
Beard is not the same as heard  
Cord is different from word.  
Cow is cow but low is low  
Shoe is never rhymed with foe.  

___

Think of hose, dose, and lose  
And think of goose and yet with choose  
Think of comb, tomb and bomb,  
Doll and roll or home and some.  
Since pay is rhymed with say  
Why not paid with said I pray?  
Think of blood, food and good.  
Mould is not pronounced like could.  
Wherefore done, but gone and lone -  
Is there any reason known?  
To sum up all, it seems to me  
Sound and letters don't agree.

# Summary and outlook

## Key points

- Structuralism foregrounds synchrony and the linguistic system.
- Linguistic signs are reciprocal, arbitrary, and conventional.
- Relations: syntagmatic (chain) vs paradigmatic (choice).
- Peirce’s triad: symbol (arbitrariness), icon (similarity), index (contiguity).
- Linguistics spans core domains and applied fields; methods and examples matter.
