## Course description {.small}

This course introduces you to the fundamental components of English
linguistics, explains the major theoretical approaches and concepts in
these fields, and examines some methodological issues.

The curriculum consists of

- phonetics and phonology,
- morphology and word-formation,
- syntax,
- semantics and lexicology,
- pragmatics,
- sociolinguistics, and
- history of English.

The aim is to provide you with a broad foundation so that you can
specialise based on your interests in subsequent courses.

### Language as a tool for communication

The Organon model [@Buhler1934Sprachtheorie]

### Structuralism

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="80%"}
The linguist who has, first and foremost, shaped linguistic thinking in the 20th century is **Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913)**. We know about his theory of language from a set of lecture notes from a lecture delivered at Geneva university, which were published by his students as *Cours de linguistique générale* in 1916.

(cf. @Kortmann2020Essentials, 5–9)

### De Saussure's primacy of synchrony and the system

Ferdinand de Saussure…

- focussed on synchrony — against the dominant trend in linguistics of the late 19th / early 20th centuries, which, almost exclusively, dealt with **language history**.

- advocated the study of *langue* rather than *parole*:
    - **langue**: the abstract linguistic system shared by all speakers of a speech community, which is independent of individual language users (→ abstract system).
    - **parole**: the concrete realisation of the abstract system provided by *langue*, which may be influenced by the speech situation, by a lack of concentration, by memory restrictions, etc. (→ concrete use by the individual).

:::: {.notes}
- 10:36–10:40 Synchrony vs history; langue vs parole.
::::

### The model of the linguistic sign

[@deSaussure1916Cours]

![The Model of the Linguistic Sign](img/model-linguistic-sign.png)

[@Bieswanger2021Introduction, 6]

---

### De Saussure’s concept of the linguistic sign

The linguistic sign has the following set of characteristics:

- **Reciprocity**: The signifier/signifiant evokes the signified/signifié, and vice versa.
- **Arbitrariness**: This relationship is unmotivated. There is no obvious reason why a particular signifier should represent a certain signified.
- **Conventionality**: This relationship between signifier and signified is based upon an implicit ‘agreement’ between speakers of speech communities.

:::: {.notes}
- 10:40–10:42 Three properties with quick examples.
::::

---

### An alternative concept of signs: Peirce

Three major types of signs depending on the relationship between signifier and signified:

- **symbol** — arbitrariness: lack of motivated link (cf. de Saussure’s linguistic sign)
- **icon** — similarity: visual, acoustic, … (e.g., meow for the cat)
- **index** — effect–cause or contiguity (i.e., proximity in space/time) (e.g., smoke as a sign of fire)

---

### Exercise: symbols, icons, indices

Classify each sign and state the underlying relationship (arbitrariness, similarity, contiguity).

1. traffic light colours
2. portrait photo
3. smoke for fire
4. onomatopoeia "meow"
5. national flag of Japan for the country
6. wet footprints on the floor

___
**Solution:**

1. symbol — arbitrariness (convention)
2. icon — similarity (visual)
3. index — effect–cause / contiguity
4. icon — similarity (acoustic)
5. symbol — arbitrariness (convention)
6. index — contiguity (proximity in space/time)
:::

---

### Paradigmatic vs syntagmatic relations

Linguistic units (in phonology, word-formation, syntax etc.) stand in two types of relationships:

- Elements which co-occur in horizontal order form syntagms or "chain relationships".
- Elements which replace each other in the same functional slot form paradigms or "choice relationships".

![](img/syntagmatic-paradigmatic.png)

:::: {.notes}
- 10:43–10:44 Define chain vs choice; 1 example.

### Aim of structuralism and emancipation from de Saussure

**Aim of Structuralism**: Identifying and describing elements in the system (on all levels of a language: sounds, words and their components, sentences and their constituents) in terms of their paradigmatic and syntagmatic relationships to other elements in the system.

Since the 1960s …

- renewed interest in language **variation** and **change** (vs primacy of synchrony)
- research into language use by individual speakers in different social situations → **pragmatics** & **sociolinguistics** (vs primacy of the system)
- recognition of **fuzzy boundaries/continua** and acceptance of dichotomies only as pedagogically useful idealisations (e.g., synchrony – diachrony, language system – language use, vocabulary – grammar, written language – spoken language)

---

### Synchrony vs diachrony

- 10:40–10:42 Diachrony example; quick pointer to semantics/lexicology.

### Descriptivism vs prescriptivism

![](img/prescriptive.jpg)

:::: {.notes}
- 10:46–10:47 Contrast briefly; avoid rabbit hole.
::::

---

### Object language vs metalanguage

**Examples:**

1. Saying *shit* is not allowed.
2. *verb* is a noun.
3. I don't know the word for *word* in Spanish.

:::: {.notes}
- 10:47–10:48 Setup for exercise.
::::

---

### Object language vs metalanguage

**Exercise:**

1. The meaning of bank is ambiguous.
2. Noun phrases often start with the words the or a.
3. Morphology is the field of language which studies the formation of new words.
4. The past tense of verbs is formed by adding the suffix -ed.

---

### Think–Pair–Share: Object vs metalanguage

- **Think**: classify 1–4 as object or metalanguage.
- **Pair**: compare and justify one change.
- **Share**

::: {.notes}
- 10:37–10:40 TPS timing; then reveal solution if enabled.
:::

::: {.content-visible when-meta="params.show_solutions"}
**Solution:**

1. The meaning of *bank* is ambiguous.
2. Noun phrases often start with the words *the* or *a*.
3. Morphology is the field of language which studies the formation of new words.
4. The past tense of verbs is formed by adding the suffix *-ed*.

### Phonetics and phonology

***Our Strange Lingo* (Lord Cromer)**

When the English tongue we speak.  
Why is break not rhymed with freak?  
Will you tell me why it's true  
We say sew but likewise few?  
And the maker of the verse,  
Cannot rhyme his horse with worse?  
Beard is not the same as heard  
Cord is different from word.  
Cow is cow but low is low  
Shoe is never rhymed with foe.  

___

Think of hose, dose, and lose  
And think of goose and yet with choose  
Think of comb, tomb and bomb,  
Doll and roll or home and some.  
Since pay is rhymed with say  
Why not paid with said I pray?  
Think of blood, food and good.  
Mould is not pronounced like could.  
Wherefore done, but gone and lone -  
Is there any reason known?  
To sum up all, it seems to me  
Sound and letters don't agree.

## Key take‑aways

- Structuralism foregrounds synchrony and the linguistic system.
- Linguistic signs are reciprocal, arbitrary, and conventional.
- Relations: syntagmatic (chain) vs paradigmatic (choice).
- Peirce’s triad: symbol (arbitrariness), icon (similarity), index (contiguity).
- Linguistics spans core domains and applied fields; methods and examples matter.
