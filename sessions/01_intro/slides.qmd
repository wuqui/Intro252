# Introduction

## Course description

This course introduces you to the fundamental components of English
linguistics, explains the major theoretical approaches and concepts in
these fields, and examines some methodological issues.

The curriculum consists of

- phonetics and phonology,
- morphology and word-formation,
- syntax,
- semantics and lexicology,
- pragmatics,
- sociolinguistics, and
- history of English.

The aim is to provide you with a broad foundation so that you can
specialise based on your interests in subsequent courses.

## Linguistic fundamentals

---

### Language as a tool for communication

The Organon model [@Buhler1934Sprachtheorie]

---

### The model of the linguistic sign

[@deSaussure1916Cours]

### Paradigmatic vs syntagmatic relations

### Langue vs parole

![](img/chess.jpeg)

**Langue**: rules of the game

**Parole**: how the game is actually played

---

### Descriptivism vs prescriptivism

![](img/prescriptive.jpg)

---

### Object language vs metalanguage

**Examples:**

1. Saying *shit* is not allowed.
2. *verb* is a noun.
3. I don't know the word for *word* in Spanish.

---

### Object language vs metalanguage

**Exercise:**

1. The meaning of bank is ambiguous.
2. Noun phrases often start with the words the or a.
3. Morphology is the field of language which studies the formation of new words.
4. The past tense of verbs is formed by adding the suffix -ed.

**Solution:**

1. The meaning of *bank* is ambiguous.
2. Noun phrases often start with the words *the* or *a*.
3. Morphology is the field of language which studies the formation of new words.
4. The past tense of verbs is formed by adding the suffix *-ed*.

### Phonetics and phonology

    ***Our Strange Lingo* (Lord Cromer)**

    When the English tongue we speak.  
    Why is break not rhymed with freak?  
    Will you tell me why it's true  
    We say sew but likewise few?  
    And the maker of the verse,  
    Cannot rhyme his horse with worse?  
    Beard is not the same as heard  
    Cord is different from word.  
    Cow is cow but low is low  
    Shoe is never rhymed with foe.  

    Think of hose, dose, and lose  
    And think of goose and yet with choose  
    Think of comb, tomb and bomb,  
    Doll and roll or home and some.  
    Since pay is rhymed with say  
    Why not paid with said I pray?  
    Think of blood, food and good.  
    Mould is not pronounced like could.  
    Wherefore done, but gone and lone -  
    Is there any reason known?  
    To sum up all, it seems to me  
    Sound and letters don't agree.

### Morphology and word-formation

1. How many parts does the word *disclaimers* consist of?
2. How can we analyse this complex word in terms of its parts?
